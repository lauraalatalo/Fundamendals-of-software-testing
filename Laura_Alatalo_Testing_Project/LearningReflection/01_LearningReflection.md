> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
    First it was really hard. I didn't know how to start. But then I just started to do that RegisterPage with LoginPage example and it was little bit more clear, when i just continued with the task.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
    I began by examining the given web pages that needed testing. I researched all the aspects that need to be considered in testing and noted them down in this report template. Once the test basis was in order, I started the testing and recorded the results.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
    I didn't try any tools, so I don't know.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
    Visual Studio Code

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
    No


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
    I have not used GitLab before, but GitHub is familiar from web development and JavaScript courses.
 


## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
    I don't know


## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
    Based on a job search site search using the terms 'Tester' and 'Automation Tester,' the most in-demand skills are: programming skills (such as Java, Python), test automation tools (Selenium, Cypress), testing frameworks (JUnit, TestNG), and understanding CI/CD processes (Jenkins, Gitlab CI).


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
    If I would continuing my career in software testing, I would need to especially develop my programming skills in Python and Java, deepen my understanding of automation tools, and improve my teamwork and communication skills.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
    This project helped to apply theoretical knowledge in practice, providing practical understanding of the complexity and importance of testing in software development. It also highlighted the significance of documentation and precise test processes. The content of the study module was comprehensive and well-structured, but I would have appreciated more examples from real testing environments.
